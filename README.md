# Rest_API_Shopping

## I developed this Rest API using
* NodeJs
* Express Framwork
* MongDB

## The project contains to categories/Routes:
1) Products
    * productId
    
    The users can post, get, delete and update products but they have the right token.
2) Orders
    * orderId
    
    The users can post, get, delete and update orders but they have the right token.
3) Users

    * login
    * signup

    The users can create new account  so then they can login and may delete their account.
